# Quest-For-Gab-Time

This is a simple Game created by the LCHS iTeam using JavaScript and the Phaser library.

To run this, first navigate to the git repository: 
```
cd Quest-For-Gab-Time
``` 
Then, run the following command(s): 
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
or on Windows: 
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
``` 

If you don't have or want python, you can use http-server with npm
```
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```

Then, go to the url http://localhost:8080 to access the game.

If you are running the command on a different machine, you need to put the IP of the machine in in replacement for localhost
